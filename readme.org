* Brainfuck in CL

Something I hacked together.

So far the code is shiet, but fun to try.

I'm sort of liking the idea of having a "IR" with a flat list of symbols, than just doing two loops over the the "IR" and mapping to the correct command.

** todo
 - [ ] Clean up code
 - [ ] Ignore whitespace
 - [X] Print the result using ASCII 8bit 
 - [X] Make the array dynamic in size
 - [ ] Validate the numbers, between 0-255
  
** Example output from tests:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
Running test: ++ 
Expected: 
Cells: #(2) to return #(2) 
Pointer: 0 to return 0 

Running test: ++- 
Expected: 
Cells: #(1) to return #(1) 
Pointer: 0 to return 0 

Running test: ++-> 
Expected: 
Cells: #(1 0) to return #(1 0) 
Pointer: 1 to return 1 

Running test: ++->< 
Expected: 
Cells: #(1 0) to return #(1 0) 
Pointer: 0 to return 0 

Running test: ++>+++++ 
Expected: 
Cells: #(2 5) to return #(2 5) 
Pointer: 1 to return 1 

Running test: ++[-] 
Expected: 
Cells: #(0) to return #(0) 
Pointer: 0 to return 0 

Running test: ++>+++++[<+>-] 
Expected: 
Cells: #(7 0) to return #(7 0) 
Pointer: 1 to return 1 
#+END_SRC
