* Brainfuck in CL

Something I hacked together.

So far the code is shiet, but fun to try.

I'm sort of liking the idea of having a "IR" with a flat list of symbols, than just doing two loops over the the "IR" and mapping to the correct command.

Ideas:

- Clean up code
- Print the result using ASCII 8bit 
- Make the array dynamic in size
- Validate the numbers, between 0-255
